## What is Data Structure
**Data Structure**: A named location used to store and organize data. For example, a family tree represents a hierarchy of family relationships.

## What is an Algorithm

**Algorithm**: A collection of steps to solve a problem. For example, baking a pizza:
- Heat the oven to 550&deg;F
- Knead the dough
- Add toppings
- ...

## Why to Learn DS & A?
1. `Time` and `Memory` efficient code can be written.
2. `DS & A` is involved in commonly asked questions in job interviews. 

## Basic Data Structures

### Stack:
**Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the top, similar to a stack of books. Common operations include:

Methods of Stack:
- `.push(Object x): void`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `.pop(): Object`: Removes and returns the topmost element.
- `.peek(): Object`: Returns the topmost element without removing it.
- `.search(Object x): int`: Returns the index of given element.

Stacks are commonly used for:
- Undo/Redo functionality in text editors
- Browser history navigation
- Backtracking algorithms (e.g., solving mazes)
- Managing function calls in programming (Call Stack)
